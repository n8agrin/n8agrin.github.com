<h1>I'm <a href="http://t.co/nate">Nate Agrin</a></h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Here's some really old <a href="http://github.com/n8agrin">code I wrote</a>, and <a href="http://instagram.com/n8agrin">some pictures I took</a>. A couple years ago I wrote the article <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/design/seven-dirty-secrets-data-visualisation-2132787">Seven Dirty Secrets of Data Visualisation</a> along with <a href="http://nickrabinowitz.com/">Nick Rabinowitz</a>. It had some legs, I wish I had written more.</h2>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>I've worked at some places you may have heard of, and others you may not have: <a href="http://splunk.com">Splunk</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://chartio.com">Chartio</a>, and now <a href="http://looker.com">Looker</a>. I could say I focus on frontend architecture, data visualization, RESTful design, and all that would be true, but I like to think I work on whatever is necessary to make a company successful.</h3>

<h3>As it turns out, Looker is the best workplace I have found. If you want to work with me, you should email me.<h3>
