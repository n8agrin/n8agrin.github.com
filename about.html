  <div class="span-9 last"><p>I'm a traveler, web developer, photographer, surfer and snowboarder. I'm interested in information visualization and how communities use communication technologies in creative, disruptive ways. I admire simple, minimalist design. I'm employed at <a href="http://www.splunk.com">Splunk</a> as a User Interface Engineer where I aspire to make fun, useful software. I write short observations on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/n8agrin">Twitter</a>, and longer comments here, often about technology. Lauren took this photo of me.</p></div>
