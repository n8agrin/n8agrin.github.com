<h2>One Whole Year Ago</h2>
<h5><span class="date">October 18, 2005 &#8211; Fairfax, VA</span></h5>
<p>One whole year ago&#8230; One year ago I was stepping off a plane and into a world I never thought I would see. One year ago I packed my winter clothes in my closet, my summer close in a backpack, and headed to the other side of the world. One year ago, and it feels like just yesterday. I literally remember specifics about my first day in New Zealand, and can recall the sequence of initial events; the alien vegetation on the way from the airport, meeting Ben in the hostel, and finding great espresso in a foreign city.</p>
<p>This week my one year, once-in-a-lifetime visa to live and work freely in New Zealand expired.  It would be untruthful to say that I was not upset by that fact.  Dishonest to think I didn’t romance the ideas of what could have been had I stayed the winter there. Where would i be now?</p>
<p>To a certain degree I regret coming home. I miss the wandering lifestyle, my crappy car, my surfboards, the sand in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n8agrin/69862001/in/set-1504232/">bed</a>, the cold hard ground of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n8agrin/71368215/in/set-1504232/">tent</a>, driving around with two people and so much stuff you couldn’t see out the back door.  I miss <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n8agrin/69861850/in/set-1504232/">kiteboarding with Sean</a> and asking Phil for a wetsuit. I miss the views from <a href="http://www.solscape.co.nz/">Solscape</a>, and the people I met there. I miss the Coromandel, the ocean and the smell of saltwater. I miss the sunrises and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n8agrin/69861637/in/set-1504232/">sunsets</a>, the rainstorms and the hot days of February, the look of the sea in the morning, the power of the water and the serenity of the environment. Most of all i miss the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n8agrin/69862078/in/set-1504232/"><span class="caps">STARS</span></a>.</p>
<p>Transformation is an interesting thing, and I think that by going somewhere new, I was able to, eventually, transform myself into someone else. I survived and I learned about what I valued in life.  Perhaps most importantly I became happy, if at least for a time. I finally admitted my inner truths to myself. I let myself be mad about the things that made me mad and happy about the things that made me happy.</p>
<p>Experiencing that has changed my perspective on not just traveling, but living. I ended with, not a new sense  of self, but a truer sense of self.</p>
<p>Now I am back in the US, with a new job and new ambitions, but ones that center around what excites me and makes me happy. Until last week I had never faced a day excited to go to work. Now I wake up knowing <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu">someone is going to pay me</a> to follow my passion.</p>
<p>I’ll end this reflection with something I wrote the other day. I was researching some <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">graduate school programs</a> and I decided to come up with a list of objectives, a credo, so to speak, of how I see and aim to live my life. This isn’t necessarily a 180 from where I was a year, or a year and a half ago, but maybe it is a testament to my transition and to my fundamental shift in attitude.</p>
<p>Goals in life:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be free, never have a cage.</li>
	<li>Stay adventurous. Explore new places, things, traditions, and beliefs.</li>
	<li>Challenge yourself, physically, mentally and spiritually. Never stop trying to push yourself to new limits.</li>
	<li>Keep learning. Keep adding new knowledge about everything.</li>
	<li>Explore and discover. Find <span class="caps">NEW</span> things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not ever be tied to a lifestyle, nothing physical is needed. Wants and desire are temporary fulfillment. True work is lasting fulfillment. Carry only the tools you need to accomplish this fulfillment, everything else is an anchor, a weight that limits your range in life.</p>
<p>Feel alive, keep asking <strong>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</strong></p>
