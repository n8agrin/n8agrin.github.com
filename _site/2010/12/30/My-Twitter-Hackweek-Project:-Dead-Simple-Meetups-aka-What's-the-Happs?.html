At the end of October, Twitter held a <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/10/hack-week.html">hackweek</a>, this is the general idea I worked on for the week which I called "What's the Happs?"<br /><br /><b>Elevator pitch:</b><br />Imagine you want to go for a bike ride in an hour and want find someone to ride with, or maybe you are looking for a place to watch a baseball game in the afternoon because you don't have a television. There currently is no good way of finding what people are doing nearby and soliciting an audience for company. What's the Happs is a quick way of broadcasting to a mass audience what you're planning on doing in the near future and finding out if anyone would like to join you, or finding out what's happening nearby and meeting up with someone. Think meetup.org meets Twitter.<br /><br /><b>Why work on this?</b><br />I was new to Twitter at the time, and a lot of the projects being kicked around seemed either to be obviously on the roadmap or not really off in left field enough for me. I felt like hackweek was an opportunity to work on something completely different, inspired of course, by the creation of Twitter from Odeo's hackweek. After trying to devise some ideas of my own, I solicited the advice of my friend Kevin (@k7lim) and asked him if he had full access to all the resources at Twitter, what would he build. He outlined an idea he had been playing with that was effectively the ability to ask a broad audience to meetup and do things together in the very near future. This idea became What's the Happs.<br /><br /><b>Version 0 - how What's the Happs got implemented in Twitter:</b><br />I implemented What's the Happs to be simply a new Tweet type. Just as you create a direct message today using the "d" prefix before the text of your Tweet, I created a "w" prefix which would shuttle the tweet into a What's the Happs queue. For example: "w Headed off to China Camp to go mountain biking at 3pm, company welcome." These What's the Happs Tweets would appear in the right dashboard panel of the new Twitter layout, based on your geolocation and the original geolocation of the What's the Happs Tweet author. The idea was that you could then click on these Tweets and see conversations around the mini-event.<br /><br />This ended up being pretty much a major failure in my eyes. First of all, the experience wasn't compelling it all. It was unclear why you'd even want to see these weird Tweets from people you didn't follow, but were geographically near you in your home dashboard. Second, there was no way to really search over all the nearby What's the Happs tweets so there was no way to get more of what was happening in the world around you outside of the 4 or 5 Tweets I displayed. There was also no way to dismiss these Tweets if they didn't have any interest for you. A lot of the failure to implement the feature more completely was my own fault. I ended up working alone in a development environment I had only had about a month's experience on.<br /><br /><b>Version 1 - What I'd like What's the Happs to be:</b><br />Ok, but really what am I trying to accomplish with What's the Happs and how is it not Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Meetup etc? At it's core, WTH is about publishing what you're going to do in the near future to a mass audience, not just people who follow you. I think this is where it differentiates itself from Twitter. It's also meant to be noncommittal. You shouldn't have to publish an event by filling out a big form nor should you have or expect to have many people necessarily show up. To me this is how it differentiates itself from Meetup and Facebook Events. It should be highly mobile. You should be able to publish something like "I'm looking for a place to watch the game tonight, anyone have a TV?" and then decide to move on to a bar and still receive updates on your phone from people who are also interested in your post so you can update them on your change of plan. Foursquare let's you approximate this with checkins, but Foursquare is decidedly about location and the now and not about what you're doing in the near future.<br /><br />Considering these thoughts, I ended up believing that it was a mistake to attempt to integrate the What's the Happs idea into Twitter itself. Instead I probably should have tried to make it its own service.  In this way it could build on top of Twitter, Meetup and Foursquare, leveraging those services to help people communicate, remain geo aware and plan lightweight events happening soon but not right now.<br /><br />To me, the minimum viable product is a simple service you can create an identity on and publish these lightweight events into loose categories. The categories should be searchable by geographic location. Each posting should have a sort of conversation view so you can see who's joining and get more information about particulars of an event. Perhaps each user could have an identity and other individuals could up-vote the mini events, giving users reputations. Beyond this minimal idea, it would be interesting to integrate into all the services mentioned previously in order to provide a broader reach into other communities.<br /><br /><b>Fin</b><br />Personally, I would love to have a service like this. I often drive to Tahoe, surf and bike alone knowing that there are probably hundreds of people doing the same things or interested in the same things who I haven't yet had the serendipity to meet. I have little reservation in admitting that this idea is a long shot and possibly violates some core social norms (meeting strangers, trust, etc) which might ultimately make it fail. But I could also imagine it being incredibly successful. For one, it might fit into an interesting niche as almost an informal dating service allowing people to meet based on interest in a noncommittal way. Or I could see it being picked up by people looking for quick groups to form up, like cyclists who are already part of a cycling group looking for new members, someone looking to get a basketball game going, or people wanting to create some kind of flash mob.<br /><br />We live in a brave new world, where our perceptions of what's normal in society are rapidly changing. Maybe, as crazy as it might sound, it's time for something like What's the Happs?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2578204452090821798-3168318987013389872?l=n8agrin.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
