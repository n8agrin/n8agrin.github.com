<p>Splunk is a search engine for loosely structured data that provides the ability to search, report and monitor information in realtime. I work on Splunk's user interface, built to run completely in a browser, and focus primarily on Splunk's client-side Javascript framework, the Python API functionality and Splunk's Python based application webserver.</p>

<p>iNaturalist is a place where users can record what they see in nature, meet other nature lovers, and learn about the natural world. It was originally developed as a final Master's project for the <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley School of Information</a> (class of 2008) by <a href="http://keudea.net">Ken-ichi Ueda</a>, Jessica Kline, myself and a host of other characters. I worked on developing the core application in Ruby on Rails, including the ability to add observations, mapping observations, connecting to outside web-based services, authentication and several social features. I also helped design workflows through the creation of wireframes and high fidelity mockups and carried out usability surveys and studies.</p>

<p><a href="http://ethnio.com">Ethnio</a> is a tool developed at Bolt Peters Inc. used to recruit real users from your website to participate in surveys. It has been primarily used by companies to find real users and help them better understand a user's motivations and needs.  As an intern, I helped Bolt Peters develop the core Ethnio application in Ruby on Rails, and wrote much of the original client-side Javascript used to generate the remote screeners as well as power the interactive portions of the application.</p>

<p>Omeka is a free, flexible, and open source web-publishing platform for the display of library, museum, archives, and scholarly collections and exhibitions created and maintained by the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu">Center for History and New Media</a> at <a href="http://www.gmu.edu">George Mason</a>. Originally envisioned by Jim Safley at CHNM, I helped lead a rewrite of the application creating a classic Model - View - Controller architecture in PHP 5.</p>
