I've long wondered what Apple might be doing with their "massive North Carolina data center":http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/01/apples-north-carolina-data-center-now-visible-on-google-earth/. There's the obvious: cloud music hosting. But what else could Apple do with that much storage and also possibly execute on better than any other company in existence?

"Ubiquitous computing":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing. Or at least the first few steps in that direction. What if they come up with a way to integrate all of your Mac devices together? Your iMac is aware of your iPhone which is aware of your Macbook Pro which is aware of your iPad.

Imagine waking up, reading part of a nytimes.com article on your iMac, but having to leave in the middle of it to catch the train to work. You take with you your iPad which, when you open it, already has the nytimes.com page you were reading loaded in Safari.

This is the kind of thing Apple could pull off with a proper cloud service. Never mind wifi syncing of your iPhone to iTunes, that would just be the tip of the iceberg.
