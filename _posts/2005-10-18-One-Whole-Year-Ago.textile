title: One Whole Year Ago
---

One whole year ago… one year ago I was stepping off a plane and into a world I never thought I would see. one year ago I packed my winter clothes in my closet, my summer close in a backpack and headed to the other side of the world. one year ago, and it feels like just yesterday. (literally, i remember specifics about that first day, and could recall the general sequence of events if anyone asked).

this week my one year, once in a lifetime visa to new zealand expired, and it would be untruthful to say that I was not upset by it, that I didn’t romance the ideas of what could have been had I stayed the winter there. where would i be now?

to a certain degree i regret coming home. i miss the wandering lifestyle, my crappy car, my surfboards, the sand in my bed, the cold hard ground of my tent, driving around with two people and so much stuff you couldn’t see out the back door. i miss kiteboarding with sean and asking phil for a wetsuit. i miss the views from solscape, and the people i met there. i miss the coromandel, the ocean and the smell of saltwater. i miss the sunrises and the sunsets, the rainstorms and the hot days of february, the look of the sea in the morning, the power of the water and the serenity of the environment. most of all i miss the STARS.

transformation is an interesting thing, and i think that by going somewhere new, i was able to, eventually, transform myself into someone else. i survived and i learned about what i valued in life, and most importantly i became happy. i finally admitted my inner truths to myself. i let myself be mad about the things that made me mad and happy about the things that made me happy.

experiencing that has changed my perspective on not just traveling, but living. i started my trip with an old sense of self, and ended with, not a new sense, but a true sense of self.

now i am back in the US, with a new job and new ambitions, but ones that center around what excites me and makes me happy. until last week I had never woken up excited to go to work. now i get up knowing someone is going to pay me to play with computers and make interesting tools for people to work with. how that excites me i can’t explain. it goes against everything else in my life that i enjoy, but i can’t deny that this excites me, entertains me and makes me happy.

so i’ll end this reflection with something i wrote the other day. i was going through some grad-school websites and i decided to come up with a list of objectives, a creedo so to speak of how i see life, and my life in particular. this isn’t necessarily a 180 from where I was a year, or a year and a half ago, but maybe it is a testamet to my transition, to my fundamental shift in attitude:

goals in life:
* be free -> never have a cage
* adventure -> explore new places, things, traditions, beliefs
* challenge -> physical, mental… never stop trying and pushing to new levels
* learn -> keep learning. keep adding new knowledge
* explore / discover -> find NEW things

do not ever be tied to a lifestyle, nothing physical is needed. wants and desire are temporary fufullment. true work is lasting fufillment. carry only the tools you need to accomplish this fufillment, everything else is an achor, a weight that limits your range in life.

FEEL ALIVE. ASK ‘WHY?’
