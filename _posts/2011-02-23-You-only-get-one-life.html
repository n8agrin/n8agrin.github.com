Found via Twitter:<br /><br /><blockquote>You only get one life. No receipt, no proof of purchase. You can't<br />take it back to the shops if bored. Hence the fact that you should<br />appreciate what you've got. Find a job you love, find people you love,<br />visit your grandparents and get to the seaside as often as possible.<br />Eat well and eat cake. Go running, go jumping. Get your five a day.<br />Laugh. Feed the cat. Fix your bike. Have a baby and smoke a cigar.<br />Camp in the woods, bake some bread and buy a trampoline.</blockquote><br />via: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/reybango/status/40151402412126208">https://twitter.com/#!/reybango/status/40151402412126208</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2578204452090821798-7981188746256501479?l=n8agrin.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
